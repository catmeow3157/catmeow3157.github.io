          <h1>Chung Chan</h1>
            <p class="bio"> I'm a CS student and Digital Art Ambassador. This site collects some of my digital 
              media-related coursework. <span> <br> I have a high interest in drawing and also wanted to share some of my experience with it, 
                especially with digital arts! </span> <span> <br> I've also corporate with my classmate to create a podcast that focuses on cancel culture. 
                  I am an audio editor in this work, so you won't hear me speaking, but instead, you will be able to listen to an appealing podcast! </span>
              <span> <br> If you would love to learn more about digital arts and cancel culture, come give it a try! </span>
